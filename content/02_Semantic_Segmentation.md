# Semantic Segmentation

[https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/](https://www.jeremyjordan.me/semantic-segmentation/)

Labels each pixel of an image with a corresponding class.

In the beginning: repurposing networks like AlexNet to generate semantic masks

U-nets - give you the fine detail of local convolutions along with the global semantic understanding of classifiers

DenseNet - uses encapsulation with dense blocks. the dense blocks have hella skip connections inside, but there are no skip connections between them.
